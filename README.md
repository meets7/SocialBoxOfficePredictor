# MACHINE LEARNING TERM PROJECT PROPOSAL 
  
##### Project Title:  
Predicting Box Office Revenue using Social Media Activity and Trends 

##### Project Idea:  
    Given the social media buzz the movie is generating and the people involved in the movie production, can we predict the revenue it’ll generate once it’s out? 
    
The idea of our project is to predict the box office collections of an upcoming movie using the attributes like the actors, director and producers of the movie (from IMDB), budget of the movie (from Wikipedia), how popular the actors appearing in the movie are (using their social media following) from Twitter and Facebook, the number of views the on the trailer on YouTube and the buzz the movie is generating based upon the searches related to it on Google and YouTube using data from Google Trends

##### Data Set:  
Data would be procured from various sources namely - Wikipedia, IMDB, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Google Trends.
